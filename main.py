## INPUT PARAMETERS

# creating an StationsPathsInput Object with inputs
# train_color is usefull only if it is "green" or "red"
this_net = StationsPathsInput( "estaciones02.csv")
this_net.start_end_stations( "A", "F" )
this_net.train_color( "normal" ) 

# getting matrix from CSV File with stations info

# Start and final stations, and train color

final = this_net.final_station

## FIND SHORTEST PATH

# dictionary representation to the stations net

# dijkstra algorithm applied to this problem
# works with dictionary representation of the net
result = dijkstra_stations( dic_net, start, final )
